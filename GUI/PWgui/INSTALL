*** INSTALLATION instructions for PWgui ***
________________________________________________________________________


The PWgui package comes in two flavors: 

   (i)  STANDALONE EXECUTABLE, which runs out of the box (but works
	only on the platform for which it has been built)

   (ii) SOURCE PACKAGE

N.B.: for the usage of repository version of PWgui see file INSTALL.repository

(i) Installation instructions for STANDALONE EXECUTABLE
________________________________________________________________________

For zipped pwgui-xxx.zip package do:
	
	* unzip pwgui-xxx.zip

whereas for tar-gzipped pwgui-xxx.tgz package do either:

	* tar zxvf pwgui-xxx.tgz 
or: 
	* gunzip -c pwgui-xxx.tgz | tar xvf -

To launch the program type either: 
     
        * ./pwgui
or 
        * pwgui


The standalone executable is always available for Linux platform, and
occasionally also for Mac and Windows.

(ii) Installation instructions for SOURCE PACKAGE
________________________________________________________________________


To use the source package you need required Tcl software, in
particular Tcl + Tk + Itcl + Itk + Iwidgets. PWgui requires the Tcl/Tk
version 8.4 or later. You may install the software from your OS
distribution. 

For example, for GNU/Linux Debian-based distributions, execute as root
(or sudo):

   * apt-get update; apt-get install iwidgets4 

(this will install also tcl/tk/itcl/itk, because iwidgets depend on them).
On fedora-based distributions, the analogous command is "dnf". Hence:

   * dnf install iwidgets

Once your computer has all the needed software, your source package is
ready to run. You only need to untar the PWgui source tarball, i.e.:

   * tar zxvf  PWgui-<version>.tgz
or
   * gunzip -c PWgui-<version>.tgz | tar xvf -

where <version> stands for version number. To launch the PWgui
program, type: pwgui. 

You may add the PWgui root directory to your PATH. 

If you would like to copy "pwgui" launcher to some common place, such
as /usr/local/bin, then you need either to define PWGUI environmental
variable so that "pwgui" will be able to locate its root directory
(i.e. source files) or alternatively hardcode it into pwgui lanucher
itself.
