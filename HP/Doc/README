The calculation of Hubbard parameters using hp.x is based 
on density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT):

"Hubbard parameters from density-functional perturbation theory", 
Phys. Rev. B 98, 085127 (2018); arXiv:1805.01805

The DFPT approach (as the linear-response cDFT approach) 
has a limitation: it is applicable only to open-shell systems.
