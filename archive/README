Archive contains the tarballs of external libraries and codes used by "make"
to build QE. Note that "CMake" stores such packages in external/ instead.
In the future, these files should be removed or replaced as follows:

- fox.tgz		fetch from git repository
- iotk-1.2.beta.tar.gz	fetch from git repository
- lapack-3.6.1.tgz	fetch from git repository
- libbeef-0.1.2.tar.gz	move to XClib directory
- plumed-1.3-qe.tar.gz  remove (is obsolete)
